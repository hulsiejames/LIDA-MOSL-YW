# LIDA-MOSL-YW
This repo contains files provided from the LIDA-MOSL-YW project, including consumption benchmarks, aggregate consumptions by both SIC at the class level and group levels. 

This repo also contains the code for our two data-processing algorithms:\
(1) - to detect suspected instances of continuous flows (leaks)\
(2) - to establish base nighttime useage flow values.
